# MazeGeneratorUnity3D

This maze generator is work with cadinal point. You need to put the Prefabs component on all the prefabs and The spawner component on an empty. Then you have to set the open point on the prefabs compoent with empty where you whant your next "wall" to spawn and then set the cardinal point that are open. After that you can put your prefabs in the right list int the spawner component and you should be good. 
Anyway if you want there is a demo scene with everything. (btw put big number in the length)
